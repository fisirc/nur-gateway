## Thwomp

<img src="./docs/media/thwomp.webp" alt="super mario thwomp" align="right" width="200" />

STOMP-compatible message queue server implementation made in Zig, **planning to
pass a 100% of STOMP tests but not there yet so blehh :3c**!!!!


### Building and deploying

Not there yet either but building should be as simple as:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

And the result should be a single statically linked binary to prevent
portability issues


### Configuration

Will probably maintain sime kind of configuration file format using a structured
human readable language like toml but not there yet either lmao!!!!
